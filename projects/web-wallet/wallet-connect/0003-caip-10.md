# CAIP-10

*For context, see the [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md) specification.*

## Abstract

In CAIP-10 an account identification scheme is defined. This is the implementation of CAIP-10 for [Hathor Network](https://hathor.network).

## Rationale

Hathor Network is a UTXO chain and wallets usually use a different address for each transaction, so a decision was made to use the first address, on the BIP32 `m/44'/280'/0'/0/0` path as an unique identifier of a Wallet's account.


## Syntax

| Component          | Description                                            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| caip10-like address| `namespace` + `":"` + `chainId` + `":"` + `address`              |
| namespace          | hathor                                                 |
| chain Id           | One of (`mainnet`, `testnet`, `privatenet`) as defined on the [CAIP-2 document](./0002-caip-2.md) |
| address            | Hathor address represented as a Base58 string          |

**Addresses Pattern:** The addresses of the Hathor’s **mainnet** and **testnet** follow a pattern. All addresses of the mainnet start with the letter H (P2PKH address) or h (P2SH address) and addresses of the testnet start whether W (P2PKH address) or w (P2SH address).


### Backwards Compatibility

Not applicable.

## Test Cases

```
# Hathor mainnet
hathor:mainnet:HSXqoFjCcUG7tCfdniujU5VTeTuF2e7g5P

# Hathor testnet
hathor:testnet:WQDn4KwWrP3dacWbn35iUgea4GPFzV4s35
```
