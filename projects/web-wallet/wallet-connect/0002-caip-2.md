## Abstract

In CAIP-2, a general blockchain identification scheme is defined. This is the implementation of [CAIP-2](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md) for the [Hathor Network](https://hathor.network/)

## Hathor Namespace

The namespace "hathor" refers to the wider Hathor Network ecosystem.

## Reference Definition

The reference addresses Hathor's two current production networks:  `mainnet` and `testnet` and also private networks by using the reference `privatenet`

## Rationale

The namespace `hathor` refers to the [Hathor Network](https://hathor.network/) ecosystem, including the `mainnet`, the current active `testnet` and any other private network with the reference `privatenet`

`mainnet` - Main network of [Hathor Network](https://hathor.network)
`testnet` - Current active testnet of Hathor Network which can be checked [here](https://hathor.network/testnet/)
`privatenet` - Private networks

## Resolution Method

One can identify the current network by observing the addresses, the addresses of the Hathor’s **mainnet** and **testnet** follow a pattern. All addresses of the mainnet start with the letter H (P2PKH address) or h (P2SH address) and addresses of the testnet start whether W (P2PKH address) or w (P2SH address). Private nets might follow different rules.

One can also detect which network a given fullnode is running on by checking the `/version` API:

```bash
curl -X GET https://<fullnode_url>/v1a/version
```

Response:

```json
{
	"version": "0.52.1",
	"network": "mainnet",
	"min_weight": 14,
	"min_tx_weight": 14,
	"min_tx_weight_coefficient": 1.6,
	"min_tx_weight_k": 100,
	"token_deposit_percentage": 0.01,
	"reward_spend_min_blocks": 300,
	"max_number_inputs": 255,
	"max_number_outputs": 255
}
```


## Test Cases

```
# Hathor mainnet
hathor:mainnet

# Hathor testnet
hathor:testnet

# Hathor privatenet
hathor:privatenet
```
